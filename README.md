CRUD Website using React and Redux Toolkit

This is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application developed using various technologies to manage data efficiently. The application includes styling with Tailwind CSS, icons from React Icons, state management using Redux Toolkit, and a mock API server powered by JSON Server.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for quickly designing and styling web applications.
- **React Icons**: A library that provides popular icon packs as React components.
- **Redux Toolkit**: A package that simplifies Redux state management by providing a set of tools and best practices.
- **JSON Server**: A mock REST API server that allows you to easily create a RESTful API using a JSON file as the data source.


run server:
json-server --watch db.json --port 8000

Development Steps
Planning the Design: Get started by planning the design and user interface of your CRUD application. Define the features and functionality I want to implement.

Implementation Code: Use React to build my app's components and pages. Make use of Tailwind CSS for styling and React Icons to add icons where needed.

State Management: Implement state management using Redux Toolkit to efficiently handle data and application state.

API Server: Set up a mock API server using the JSON Server. Create endpoints for CRUD operations and define data structures in db.json.

Testing and Debugging: Thoroughly test my app, and debug any issues that arise.

Deployment: Deploy your CRUD website to the hosting service of your choice, such as Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
